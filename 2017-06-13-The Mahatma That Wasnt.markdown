“My life is my message.”- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi

<p> M. K. Gandhi, or as he was more popularly known, Mahatma Gandhi, was one of the most influential leaders of his time – a towering personality, not so much in appearance as in demeanour. Our literature on modern history is replete with episodes of the greatness of this man, even penning him down as the ‘Father of the Nation’. Gandhiji was the last born of Karamchand and Putlibai and was brought up in Porbandar, Gujarat. He was married to Kasturbai and fathered four sons- Harilal, Manilal, Ramdas and Devdas. He pursued law in London and became a barrister, finally setting sail to South Africa to provide his legal services. </p>

<p> Non-Cooperation Movement, Quit India Movement, Dandi march, non-violence, swadeshi, satyagrah, harijans, the white loincloth, the round spectacles and the lathi are all those things that we’ve been conditioned to believe, the ‘Mahatma’ was associated with. As unsurprising as it may be, our textbooks were a medium to look back upon the work of this gentlemen in monochromes alone, more often than not, that monochrome being white- a colour that stands for peace and purity. However, I do not recall coming across a single section in those books that may have addressed the question of the validity of Gandhiji’s ways, his decisions, the approach he took for India to regain her independence from the clutches of the British; or the rationale behind the principles he laid down for himself and others to follow without much argument. I have been wondering for quite some time now, as to how one person single-handedly manoeuvred the population of millions to accept him as the harbinger of all things good and pure, without severe rebellion or debate. </p>
