>“I have had such a rough week!”  
>“Why? What happened?”  
>“I have been slogging for fifteen hours every single day this week which apparently ‘isn’t good enough’ for my boss.”  
>“You have just started out at your job. It will get better with time.”  
>“That is what I told myself but I seem to be getting nowhere with this. I hate my job.”  
>“So, what now?”


>“He proposed to me last night!”  
>“What?! Oh my God! That is amazing news! Congratulations!”  
>“Yeah, thanks!”  
>“Why do you sound incredibly low for someone who just got engaged?”  
>“I didn’t.”  
>“What do you mean you didn’t?”  
>“I told him I needed some time to think about it.”  
>“But why? You guys are perfect together! You do love him, right?”  
>“I do. But marriage is a big decision and I don’t know if I’m ready yet.”

>“His health seems to be deteriorating by the day. This is not good for him.”  
>“I consulted a doctor regarding his situation and he said that getting over something like this could take forever. He is unable to find a proper channel to vent his emotions. Until and unless he starts talking, the possibility of his springing back is negligible.”  
>“Understandably. His mother was all he had.”  
>“He desperately needs a change of scene and I think I know what might just help.”  


>“I had never thought I would live to see this day.”  
>“I know. Me neither.”  
>“Are their problems really that bad?”  
>“Well, in the last seven years, the only thing they have done together is fight, so I guess, yeah. May be the divorce is the only way out.”  
>“This will smother me to death. I need some air!”  


>“In the last two years, I have managed to save some thirty thousand rupees.”  
>“Great! I hear party songs in my head already!”  
>“No way!”  
>“Then what are you planning to do with all that money?”

Does it not amaze you that in all the years of your existence, you might not have had the chance to see even a tiny fraction of the living world? Does it not excite you that there are so many people, cultures, places, cuisines and heritages yet to be explored by you?  Doesn’t it bother you that all you have is one short life, in which you must squeeze in the desire to feel alive and the urge to witness the magnificence of life along side accomplishing all that is expected of you?

Leading the lives that we do, it is not difficult to imagine how often and easily we find ourselves enveloped in stress, confusion and hopelessness. Every once in a while we all need a dose of life- the kind that the movies made us believe, existed. Remember how those short trips you took as a kid with your family? Haven’t they made for the fondest memories you cherish even to this day?

Travelling, more than anything else, lends one a new perspective towards life- it enables one to think and view things in much more than monochromatic colours. Sometimes, taking a peek into the world beyond the four walls of one’s own space allows for one’s focus to shift from hardships to the things seldom appreciated. It shows us what it is that is worth one’s time and energy, and what is not. Getting away from one’s comfort zone presents more than one opportunity to leave behind the baggage that has been carried for way too long- to accept the inevitable rendezvous with the changes one did not want to face.

So travel while you can. Bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be. Unwind and detoxify. Learn to look up to the sun hidden behind the cluster of dark clouds the rays of which form a soothing canopy over the sea. Walk bare foot on the sand and watch the water wash away the stress one wave at a time. Make room for detours.  Free your plagued mind from all the thoughts that are pinning you down. Be not afraid to not lose sight of things. Rediscover comfort in solitary solace. Let not life escape you!

There will always be a million reasons to say no, but only one to say yes- YOU.
